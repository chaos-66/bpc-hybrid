"""Sun et al. (2024) Stage 3: Gold-blind development Rule Record adapter.

Extracts a minimal Sun-compatible Rule Record (actions, actors, order
relations) from the frozen ``rule_text`` of the S3.2/S3.3 blank pack using
deterministic spaCy dependency parsing plus the shared external signalword
lexicon. It is a **development adapter**: the full Stage 2 Rules-Only method
(BERT-TextCNN + CoreNLP/Tregex/Tsurgeon + public marker lexicon) is not run
here (external CoreNLP runtime unavailable), so this adapter's output must
never be presented as formal B0 output.

Forbidden inputs (never read): decision_relevant, decision_violation_type,
candidate_relevant, candidate_violation_type, candidate_evidence,
candidate_location.
